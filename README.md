# Crypto Capital - Clean Architecture with MVVM Kotlin
The Crypto Capital - App consuming a [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) to display top 100 crypto coins it has been built with clean architecture principles, Repository Pattern, and MVVM pattern as well as Architecture Components.

This app also shows the usage of the Navigation Architecture Component.

**App features:**
- List of Top 100 Crypto Coins
- Detail of Coins
- Price changes of coin in a graph

## Architecture
The Clean Architecture MVVM pattern emphasizes the separation of concerns and modularity of code by organizing it into distinct layers. The pattern encourages a clear separation between business logic and presentation logic, and promotes testability and maintainability of the codebase. This approach can be particularly useful for large-scale projects, where code organization and scalability become increasingly important. In this approach, the Clean Architecture principles are combined with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and implemented using the Kotlin programming language.

## Modules:
* **app module** - It uses all the components and classes related to Android Framework. It gets the data from domain layer and shows on UI. (**access all the modules**)
* **data** - The data layer implements the repository interface that the domain layer defines. This layer provide a single source of truth for data. It contains `remote` (which holds code to get data from webserver), `Local` (which holds code to get data from local DB ), `sharedPref` (which holds code to get data from Shared Preference) (Kotlin module that **can only access domain module**)
* **domain** - The domain layer contains the UseCases that encapsulate a single and very specific task that can be performed. This task is part of the business logic of the application. (Kotlin module that **cannot access any other module**)
* **base_module** - Contains all the base classes like `BaseFragment`, `BaseViewModel` and `BaseAdapter` which helps to reduce the duplication of the code. (**access data and domain modules**)
